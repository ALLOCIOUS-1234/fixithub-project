📱 Fixithub – Community Issue Reporting & Tracking Platform
🚀 Overview
Fixithub is a web and mobile platform that enables citizens to report local issues such as potholes, poor waste management, corruption, and infrastructure problems to the relevant authorities. Users can post issues, track updates, and interact with both public and private service providers — creating a transparent and engaging civic engagement experience.

Real-time notifications to government agencies or private sector contractors.

A community discussion space like Instagram (comments, likes, sharing updates).

Accountability through transparency and geolocation tagging.

✅ Explore feed of issues around your area
✅ Private contractors can showcase quick-fix solutions
